Sometimes life gives you the strangest teachers. Recently, mine happened to be my niece. I was casually visiting her, and to my surprise, she was busy sliding beads on an **abacus** to calculate addition and subtraction. Naturally, I was intrigued.

So I asked her, in my most polite uncle-voice, *“Hey champ, can you teach me how that works?”* And in return, she gave me the sassiest reply: *“Nope.”*

I was left staring at her tiny fingers moving beads like a wizard. And there I was — a grown adult — utterly defeated by a child armed with an ancient calculator.

That evening, curiosity got the better of me. I ended up in the black hole called **YouTube University**, searching: *“How to use an abacus?”* And, oh boy, what a rabbit hole!

## A Tiny Dose of History

The **abacus** is one of the oldest calculating devices known to humankind. Historians trace its roots back to **Mesopotamia (around 2300 BC)**, and it has appeared in various forms across cultures — from the Roman *Calculi* to the Chinese *Suanpan* and the Japanese *Soroban*.

In short: when humans got tired of counting pebbles on the ground, they decided to put those pebbles on rods. And thus, the abacus was born.

## How to Use an Abacus (Without Annoying Your Niece)

Now, let’s get to the good part — how this bead-sorcery actually works.

### The Basics

* Each rod represents a **place value** (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.).
* Beads are divided into two parts: upper (usually 1 bead worth 5 units) and lower (usually 4 beads worth 1 unit each).
* To count, you simply slide beads toward the central beam.

### Addition

1. Start from the rightmost rod (ones place).
2. Add numbers by moving beads upwards.
3. If beads overflow (e.g., more than 9 in the ones place), reset that rod and carry over to the next rod.

### Subtraction

1. Start again from the rightmost rod.
2. Remove beads to subtract.
3. If you don’t have enough beads to subtract, borrow from the next higher place value (like in paper subtraction).

### Carry & Borrow (The Fun Part)

* Carry in addition means resetting a rod and pushing one bead up in the next rod.
* Borrow in subtraction is the same logic but in reverse — you pull beads down from the next higher rod.

### Why It Works

The abacus makes arithmetic *visual and tactile*. Your fingers are literally moving numbers, which makes it easier to grasp concepts like carrying and borrowing.

## Final Thoughts

The abacus is more than just a calculator — it’s a bridge between ancient wisdom and modern learning. Plus, it’s humbling to realize that a device older than pizza can still outperform you at math.

Next time I visit my niece, I’ll be ready. And this time, maybe I’ll impress her by sliding beads with confidence instead of confusion.

*P.S.: Dear niece, if you’re reading this — your uncle has leveled up.*
